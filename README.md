## Acknowledgements

It is ritual that scholars express their gratitude to their supervisors.  This acknowledgement is very special to me to express my deepest sense of gratitude and pay respect to my supervisor, Dripta Mj, School of Mathematical Sciences, for his constant encouragement, guidance, supervision, and support throughout the completion of my project. His close scrutiny, constructive criticism, and intellectual insight have immensely helped me in every stage of my work. I would like to thank him for patiently answering my often naive questions related to machine learning. I am also thankful to Swathy Prabhu Maharaj for arranging Asus RTX 2080 Ti GPU (with 64 GB RAM) to hasten the research. I would also thank Tamal Maharaj and Dr. Jadab Kumar Pal for their suggestions.

The Authors would also like to thank [lixiaolei1982](https://github.com/lixiaolei1982/Keras-Implementation-of-U-Net-R2U-Net-Attention-U-Net-Attention-R2U-Net.-) and [nibtehaz](https://github.com/nibtehaz/MultiResUNet) for open sourcing their implementations.
